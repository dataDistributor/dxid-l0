# dxID Layer0 - Deployment Version 2.0

## Current Issues:
- Railway not deploying latest code
- /status endpoint missing (404 error)
- State roots still the same
- CLI can't connect properly

## Required Fixes:
- ✅ CLI connects to Railway instead of localhost
- ✅ State root uniqueness implemented
- ✅ /status endpoint added to node
- ✅ Enhanced persistent storage
- ✅ Railway configuration fixed

## Deployment Status:
- Railway needs manual redeploy
- Current deployment is running old code
- Build logs need to be checked for errors

## Next Steps:
1. Manually redeploy in Railway dashboard
2. Check build logs for any errors
3. Verify /status endpoint works
4. Test CLI connection
5. Verify unique state roots
