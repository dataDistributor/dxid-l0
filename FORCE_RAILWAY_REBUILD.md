# FORCE RAILWAY REBUILD

This file is used to force Railway to detect changes and rebuild the deployment.

## Current Issues
- Railway deployment only has `/health` endpoint working
- `/status`, `/balance`, `/debug` and other endpoints return 404
- CLI connects to Railway but can't use wallet features

## Latest Changes
- Updated CLI to properly connect to Railway deployment
- Fixed RPC endpoint configuration
- Added proper error handling for limited API endpoints

## Force Rebuild
Last updated: 2025-01-22 12:00:00 UTC

## Deployment Status
- Railway is running but with limited API
- Need to force redeployment with latest code
- Dockerfile should expose port 8080 correctly
- All API endpoints should be available after rebuild

## Next Steps
1. Force Railway redeployment
2. Test all API endpoints
3. Verify CLI wallet functionality
4. Ensure production readiness
