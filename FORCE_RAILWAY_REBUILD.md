This file forces Railway to detect changes and rebuild the deployment.

## Build Information
- **Timestamp**: 2025-08-22 13:40 UTC
- **Fix**: Debugging Docker build issues with specific Rust version and verbose output
- **Status**: Investigating build failures

## Changes Made
1. Fixed `spawn_blocking` and `MutexGuard` Send trait issue
2. Fixed Cargo.lock version 4 compatibility by updating to Rust 1.75.0
