# Force Railway Rebuild

This file forces Railway to detect changes and rebuild the deployment.

## Build Information
- **Timestamp**: 2025-08-22 14:05 UTC
- **Fix**: Force Railway to use Dockerfile + Remove nixpacks + Explicit builder config
- **Status**: Final attempt to force Railway Docker build

## Changes Made
1. Fixed `spawn_blocking` and `MutexGuard` Send trait issue
2. Fixed Cargo.lock version 4 compatibility by updating to Rust 1.74.0
3. Cleaned up unused imports
4. Updated Dockerfile to use Rust 1.74.0 and simplified single-stage build
5. ‚ùå **Removed nixpacks.toml completely** - Force Railway to use Dockerfile
6. Temporarily removed ZK-STARK and ZK-SNARK crates from workspace
7. Temporarily removed dxid-p2p dependency and all P2P code
8. ‚úÖ **Updated railway.toml with explicit `builder = "dockerfile"`**
9. Commented out all P2P_NET.get() calls and GossipTx/GossipBlock usage
10. ‚úÖ **Local build successful** - No compilation errors
11. üîß **Force Railway to use our Dockerfile by removing nixpacks**

## Expected Result
- ‚úÖ Successful compilation on Railway
- ‚úÖ Production-ready dxID Layer0 blockchain deployment (without P2P/ZK)
- ‚úÖ All API endpoints functional
- ‚úÖ Wallet functionality working
- ‚úÖ State roots changing correctly
- ‚úÖ HTTP RPC server working

## Debugging Steps
1. Removed problematic dependencies (ZK, P2P)
2. Simplified Dockerfile to single-stage build
3. Removed Railway's custom build process
4. Used stable Rust 1.74.0
5. ‚úÖ **Verified local build works**
