# Force Railway Rebuild

This file forces Railway to detect changes and rebuild the deployment.

## Build Information
- **Timestamp**: 2025-08-22 13:45 UTC
- **Fix**: Removed ZK crates temporarily + Use Rust 1.74.0 for stability
- **Status**: Testing core build without ZK dependencies

## Changes Made
1. Fixed `spawn_blocking` and `MutexGuard` Send trait issue
2. Fixed Cargo.lock version 4 compatibility by updating to Rust 1.74.0
3. Cleaned up unused imports
4. Updated Dockerfile to use Rust 1.74.0 and conservative build steps
5. Updated nixpacks.toml with Rust 1.74.0 and step-by-step build
6. Temporarily removed ZK-STARK and ZK-SNARK crates from workspace
7. Added cargo check step before build for better error reporting

## Expected Result
- ✅ Successful compilation on Railway
- ✅ Production-ready dxID Layer0 blockchain deployment (without ZK)
- ✅ All API endpoints functional
- ✅ P2P networking enabled
- ✅ Wallet functionality working
- ✅ State roots changing correctly

## Debugging Steps
1. Show Rust and Cargo versions
2. Show directory contents
3. Use cargo check before build
4. Remove ZK dependencies temporarily
5. Use conservative Rust 1.74.0 version
