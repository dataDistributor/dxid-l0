# FORCE RAILWAY REBUILD

This file is used to force Railway to detect changes and rebuild the deployment.

## Current Issues
- Railway deployment only has `/health` endpoint working
- `/status`, `/balance`, `/debug` and other endpoints return 404
- CLI connects to Railway but can't use wallet features
- Railway is running old deployment despite multiple pushes

## Latest Changes
- Updated CLI to properly connect to Railway deployment
- Fixed RPC endpoint configuration
- Added proper error handling for limited API endpoints
- Switched to nixpacks build system
- Removed Dockerfile approach

## Force Rebuild
Last updated: 2025-01-22 12:30:00 UTC

## Deployment Status
- Railway is running but with limited API
- Need to force redeployment with latest code
- Using nixpacks build system
- All API endpoints should be available after rebuild

## Next Steps
1. Force Railway redeployment with nixpacks
2. Test all API endpoints
3. Verify CLI wallet functionality
4. Ensure production readiness

## CRITICAL: Railway is not redeploying properly
- Multiple pushes have not triggered new deployment
- May need manual intervention in Railway dashboard
- Consider alternative deployment platform if Railway continues to fail
