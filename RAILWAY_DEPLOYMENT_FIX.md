# Railway Deployment Fix

## Issue
The Railway deployment is failing with Docker build errors during the `cargo build --release --package dxid-node` step.

## Root Cause
The issue is likely caused by:
1. Platform-specific dependencies in the ZK crates
2. Build timeouts on Railway
3. Memory constraints during compilation

## Solution
We've implemented several fixes:

### 1. Dockerfile
Created a proper Dockerfile that:
- Uses multi-stage builds to reduce image size
- Installs necessary system dependencies
- Runs as non-root user for security
- Properly handles the build process

### 2. Nixpacks Configuration
Updated `nixpacks.toml` to:
- Include necessary system packages (openssl, gcc)
- Set proper build environment variables
- Handle the build process more robustly

### 3. Railway Configuration
Simplified `railway.toml` to:
- Use the correct start command
- Set proper health check settings
- Remove problematic configuration options

## Deployment Steps

1. **Push the updated code to GitHub**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Railway deployment with Docker and nixpacks"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Redeploy on Railway**
   - Go to your Railway project
   - Trigger a new deployment
   - Monitor the build logs

3. **Verify Deployment**
   - Check that the build completes successfully
   - Verify the health check passes
   - Test the API endpoints

## Troubleshooting

If the deployment still fails:

1. **Check Build Logs**: Look for specific error messages in Railway build logs
2. **Memory Issues**: The ZK crates might be using too much memory during compilation
3. **Dependencies**: Some dependencies might not be available in Railway's environment

## Alternative Solutions

If the issue persists, consider:
1. **Remove ZK crates temporarily**: The node works fine without them
2. **Use a different deployment platform**: Consider DigitalOcean, AWS, or Google Cloud
3. **Optimize dependencies**: Remove unused dependencies to reduce build time

## Current Status
- ✅ Local build works with ZK crates
- ✅ Node runs correctly without ZK crates
- ✅ All API endpoints are functional
- ⚠️ Railway deployment needs testing with new configuration
