# Railway Deployment Fix - CRITICAL

## Current Problem:
- Railway is running OLD deployment (only /health endpoint works)
- All other endpoints return 404 (missing)
- CLI cannot perform blockchain operations
- State roots are still the same

## Required Actions:

### 1. Manual Railway Redeploy (IMMEDIATE)
1. Go to Railway Dashboard: https://railway.app/dashboard
2. Find project: dxid-l0
3. Click "Deployments" tab
4. Click "Redeploy" button
5. Watch build logs for errors

### 2. Check Build Logs
- Look for compilation errors
- Check for dependency issues
- Verify build completes successfully

### 3. Verify Deployment
After redeploy, test these endpoints:
- ✅ /health (should work)
- ✅ /status (should work - NEW)
- ✅ /balance/{address} (should work - NEW)
- ✅ /admin/apikeys (should work - NEW)
- ✅ /submitTx (should work - NEW)

### 4. Test CLI Functions
- ✅ Node status check
- ✅ Wallet balance
- ✅ Send transactions
- ✅ API key management
- ✅ Network management

## Expected Results:
- All endpoints working
- Unique state roots per block
- Full CLI functionality
- Production-ready blockchain

## If Railway Still Fails:
- Check Railway service status
- Consider switching to different platform
- Verify GitHub integration
- Check Railway build limits
