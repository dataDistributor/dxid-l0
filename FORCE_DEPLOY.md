# Force Railway Redeploy

This file forces Railway to redeploy with the latest code.

## Latest Changes:
- ✅ Fixed CLI to connect to Railway instead of localhost
- ✅ Fixed state root uniqueness issues
- ✅ Added proper /status endpoint
- ✅ Enhanced persistent storage

## Deployment Status:
- Railway needs to redeploy with latest code
- Current deployment is running old version (missing /status endpoint)
- State roots are still the same due to old code

## Next Steps:
1. Railway will detect this change and redeploy
2. New deployment will have all fixes
3. CLI will connect properly to Railway
4. State roots will be unique for each block
